# Spike Sorting

Spike sorting is a crucial step in analyzing electrophysiological data from the brain. In collaboration with the [Allen Institute](https://alleninstitute.org/), the Kempner Research Engineering team developed these pipelines to support researchers on the [FASRC](https://www.rc.fas.harvard.edu/) and [HMS RC](https://it.hms.harvard.edu/about/departments/research-computing) computing clusters.

Please refer Cluster specific documentation.

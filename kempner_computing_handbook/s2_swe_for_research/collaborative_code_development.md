# Collaborative Code Development

Collaborative code development promotes reproducible, maintainable, and scalable research software.  
This section provides an overview of the tools and practices, from version control and branching strategies to continuous integration, dependency management, and secure automation, that enable research teams to work together efficiently. Each topic below will be expanded with detailed guidance and curated links to external resources in future revisions.

## Version Control Systems (VCS)

- Git fundamentals: branching, merging, rebase vs merge, resolving conflicts.  
- Remote workflows: GitHub for code hosting, access control, pull requests.  
- Best practices: commit messaging conventions, review processes, PR.

## Branching & Collaboration Models

- Common workflows: Git Flow, trunk-based development.  
- Release strategies: tagging, versioning, hotfix and maintenance branches.

## Code Review & Continuous Integration (CI)

- Peer review value: maintaining quality, knowledge sharing.  
- Automated pipelines: linting, static analysis, automated testing on every PR.

## Merge Conflicts & Resolution Strategies

- Handling conflicts: manual resolution tips, interactive merges.  
- Mitigating splits: frequent rebasing, small incremental PRs.

## Real‑Time Collaboration Tools

- Live coding platforms: Visual Studio Live Share.  
- Collaborative IDE support: pair programming features.

## Modular Design

- Organizing around modules or services to reduce merge conflicts.

## Feature Flags & Controlled Integration

- Using feature branches and toggles to integrate untested code.  
- Gradual deployment: how this aids shared codebases in research.

## Testing Ecosystem

- Unit, integration, end-to-end testing basics.  
- Using test frameworks like pytest.

## Dependency & Environment Management

- Ensuring reproducibility with `requirements.txt`, Conda, Docker.  
- Maintaining consistent setups across collaborators.

## Code Consistency Tools

- Enforcing style: linters (flake8, eslint), formatters (black, Prettier).  
- Pre‑commit hooks and lint‑staged for automated checks.

## Security, Licensing & Code Compliance

- Selecting and documenting open‑source licenses.  
- Managing credentials: secrets, API tokens, `.gitignore` best practices.

## Integrations

- Automation in CI pipelines: building & testing on push.

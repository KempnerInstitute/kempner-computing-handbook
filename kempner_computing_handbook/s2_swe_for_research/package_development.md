# Package Development

Packaging your code turns scripts into reusable, shareable tools that support collaboration and long-term maintenance. This section outlines the essential steps for developing, testing, and distributing research software as a package.

Why Package Your Code?
- Encourages modularity, reusability, and distribution.  
- Makes it easier to share code within your group or publish with a paper.  
- Enables versioning and reproducibility across projects.

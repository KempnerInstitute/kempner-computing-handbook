# Introduction and Basics

High-Performance Computing (HPC) refers to the use of supercomputers and parallel processing techniques to solve complex computational problems. HPC systems are designed to deliver high performance and are used for scientific, engineering, and data-intensive applications. These systems are capable of processing large volumes of data and performing complex calculations at a much faster rate than traditional computing systems. In this handbook, we will concentrate on utilizing HPC systems for research and applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Getting Access to the Cluster

In order to access the Kempner Institute AI cluster, you will need to have an account on the cluster. Use the following link to request access to the cluster. 

- https://portal.rc.fas.harvard.edu/request/account/new

For account approver please follow these instructions:

- If you are in a **Kempner-affiliated lab**: Select PI as PI and approver on the FASRC portal.
- If you are a **graduate fellow**:
  - FAS or SEAS Graduate Programs: Select your PI as PI and approver.
  - HMS Graduate Programs: Select your PI as PI and approver, or if your PI isnâ€™t listed or you do not yet have a PI select `Spencer Pruitt` as PI and approver. 
- If you are an **undergraduate student** in a Kempner research program (KURE/KRANIUM):
  - If you are working with a mentor who is a co-director, institute investigator, or associate faculty:
    - Select your PI as PI and approver.
  - If you are working with a mentor who is an affiliate faculty member and you have been approved for Kempner cluster access (via email notification):
    - Select your PI as PI and approver if they have an FASRC lab account (i.e. if they show up as option for approver) 
    - Otherwise, request `Bala Desinghu` as PI and approver.
- If you are a **research fellow**: Select `Elise Porter` as PI and `Elise Porter`, `Max Shad`, or `Bala Desinghu` as approver. 	
- If you are a **PI**: Email `Elise Porter` or `Max Shad` to get access to the cluster after you have submitted the request. 
- If **none** of the above: if you believe you are qualified to access the Kempner cluster, email `Max Shad`.

Your approver will need to log in to the FASRC portal and approve your account creation request.

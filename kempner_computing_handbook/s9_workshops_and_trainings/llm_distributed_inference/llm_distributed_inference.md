# Large Language Model Distributed Inference Workshop


## Workshop Summary

This workshop provides hands-on training on hosting and running inference for large language models that exceed the memory capacity of a single GPU. Participants work with the vLLM library to host large Llama models, including those with 70 billion and 405 billion parameters, on an HPC cluster. The workshop covers prompting these models, extracting logits, and parallelizing prompts to maximize efficiency of GPU resources. 

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Familiarity with LLMs
- Familiarity with high performance computing (HPC) 
- Access to the FASRC cluster

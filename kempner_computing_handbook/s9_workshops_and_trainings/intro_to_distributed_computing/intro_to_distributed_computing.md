# Introduction to Distributed Computing Workshop

## Workshop Summary

This workshop covers the types of problems that distributed computing can address and key forms of communication between computers.  The workshop focuses on two widely-used forms of distributed computing: embarrassingly parallel processes for tasks like hyperparameter sweeps and distributed data parallel (DDP) processes, which facilitate training machine learning models across multiple GPUs.

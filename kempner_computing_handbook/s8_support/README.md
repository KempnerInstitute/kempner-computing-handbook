# Support and Troubleshooting

If you are new to the FASRC cluster, we recommend taking the FASRC new users training: 
  - https://www.rc.fas.harvard.edu/training/. 
You can also watch a pre-recorded version: 
  - https://docs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/fasrc-getting-started-23-mar-2022.mp4 ,  
or look at their online documentation and training videos: 
  - https://docs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/kb/introduction-to-cluster-online. 
  
FASRC also hosts other workshops that may be of interest. Additionally, FASRC holds zoom office hours every Wednesday from 12 - 3 pm.

For further support, If you are encountering difficulties with the cluster, contacting the [FASRC Help desk](https://portal.rc.fas.harvard.edu/login/?next=/rcrt/tickets/) is often a great resource. You can also reach out to the `#cluster-users` channel in the Kempner Slack space for Kempner-cluster specific questions, concerns, and advice. For access to this Slack channel, please contact [Nikki Shawn](https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/people/our-people/nikki-shawn/). Should these resources not address your needs or if you have additional inquiries, reaching out to [Max Shad](https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/people/our-people/max-shad/) is recommended. If you have suggestions for updates to this user guide, posting them in the #cluster-users channel in the Kempner Slack space is encouraged.

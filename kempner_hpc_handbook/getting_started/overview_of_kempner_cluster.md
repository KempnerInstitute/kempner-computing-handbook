# Overview of Kempner Institute HPC Cluster

The Kempner institute has dedicated compute resources for its mission toward advanced research on intelligence from biological, cognitive, and computational perspectives. 

## What is the Kempner Institute HPC Cluster?

The Kempner cluster is a cluster of GPUs networked such that the whole cluster can be used for single jobs.  The Kempner Institute collaborates with FASRC on the infrastructure and maintenance of this cluster.

## Who is eligible to use the Kempner Institute HPC Cluster?

In general terms, the cluster is reserved for individuals who are either associated with a lab that is affiliated with the Kempner Institute or those who are engaged in a project that has received approval from the Kempner Institute.

## Can I buy into the Kempner Institute HPC Cluster?

If you have a Kempner Institute affiliation, you may request to contribute funds towards a Kempner cluster purchase. If you contribute funds we will increase your priority on the cluster to reflect the proportion of the cluster you have contributed. Please see the Cluster Governance guidelines for more information: https://sites.harvard.edu/kempner/computing/

## How is priority set on the Kempner Institute HPC Cluster?

Priority is set through Fairshare scheduling.   For more information, please see the Cluster Governance guidelines: https://sites.harvard.edu/kempner/computing/


## Can I reserve GPUs on the Kempner Institute HPC Cluster?

Generally we hope to have enough GPUs available on the cluster for most use cases.  However, for situations in which you need a large number of GPUs that are dedicated for a period of time, or need a smaller subset for a longer period of time, you can make a reservation request. Please see the full governance guidelines for further details: https://sites.harvard.edu/kempner/computing/

## Where is the Kempner Institute HPC Cluster located physically?

The cluster is located at the [Massachusetts Green High-Performance Computing Center](https://www.mghpcc.org) (MGHPCC) in Holyoke, MA. This is a state-of-the-art datacenter that is shared among the Boston-area universities. It runs off of hydropower, making it one of the “greenest” computing centers in the world. FASRC also provides co-located [storage resources](https://docs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/kb/storage-service-center/) at MGHPCC.

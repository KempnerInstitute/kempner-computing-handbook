# Shared Data/Model Repository

We host several popular ML datasets and models on the Kempner HPC cluster. This approach reduces the need for multiple transfers of the same data/model by researchers and provides a central, read-only repository for all Kempner Institute users to access for their ML workflows. Only the admin team has write access, but users can submit requests for popular data/models. After a careful review, we may place a copy in the shared data/model repository. The current path on the cluster is:

```bash
DATA_PATH=/n/kempner_shared/Everyone/data
MODEL_PATH=/n/kempner_shared/Everyone/models
```

```{note}
We will develop a web interface later for data and model discovery.
